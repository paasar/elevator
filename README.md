# Extreme startup coding competition - Elevator logic

Ever waited too long for an elevator to come?
Now is your chance to prove how to program an elevator that is always in the correct place.

This project offers a server and a few client templates.

Clients are REST servers which are polled by the server for their next desired action.
Communication data format is JSON.

See server and client readme files for more detailed information.

## Prerequisites

You will need Leiningen to run the server.

For client programs following programs are needed:
* Clojure: Leiningen
* Java: maven
* JavaScript: node.js
* Python: web.py

There is also a Swing GUI based client for manual elevator guidance.
